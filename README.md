# Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates object detection on videos and images using YOLOv8 with Python. The detected objects are annotated on frames and saved as a JSON file. 

## Project Structure

```
object-detection/
├── Photos/                # Folder for storing images (optional input)
├── Videos/                # Folder for storing videos (input source)
│   └── dog.mp4            # Example video file
├── main.py                # Main script for object detection
├── output.json            # JSON output file (generated by the script)
├── README.md              # Documentation (this file)
requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 is required.
- Install dependencies using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the zipped folder.
2. Ensure the project structure matches the one above.
3. Place your video file in the `Videos` folder or an image in the `Photos` folder.
4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. View the processed frames and check `output.json` for object detection results.

## Output

- Detected objects are displayed on video frames in real time.
- The JSON file (`output.json`) contains details of detected objects, including:
  - Object name
  - Bounding box coordinates
  - Confidence score
  - Sub-objects (optional, currently empty)

## Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following dependencies:
```
opencv-python
cvzone
ultralytics
```

Ensure the correct Python version and dependencies are installed for smooth execution.
